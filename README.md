This repo is a direct clone of [tvkent/Degeneracy](https://github.com/tvkent/Degeneracy) with a few minor modifications
to enable the white clover (_Trifolium repens_) genome and annotation file to be used as inputs. I've also modified
`get_4fold_sites.sh` to accept command-line arguments in the following order: gff, fasta, outpath.
